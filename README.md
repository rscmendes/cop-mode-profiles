# The Project COP-MODE

COP-MODE (COntext-aware Privacy protection for MObile DEvices) is a research project led by the University of Coimbra, the University of Porto and the University of Cambridge aiming at enhancing the privacy of mobile devices.

The objective of this project is to develop a privacy manager that is:
* **Automatic** -- Automation reduces warning fatigue and intrusiveness generated by constant permission prompts.
* **Context-Aware** -- Privacy is highly context-dependent. It depends on where we are, on what we are doing and with whom. A context-aware privacy mechanism is capable to adapt in order to respect personal privacy preferences as a function of each context.
* **Personalized** -- Privacy is also subjective and personal. A personalized mechanism must learn to adjust the privacy settings in accordance with personal preferences.
