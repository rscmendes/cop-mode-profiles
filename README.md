# COP-MODE Privacy Profiles

This repository contains the code to build privacy profiles with COP-MODE's 
data. The description of the data can be found here: 
[https://cop-mode.dei.uc.pt/dataset](https://cop-mode.dei.uc.pt/dataset).

If you are interested in using the dataset feel free to contact us 
at [cop-mode@dei.uc.pt](mailto:cop-mode@dei.uc.pt).

### Setup

1. After downloading the data, extract it to the folder `data`. 
2. Run `pipenv install` followed by `pipenv shell`. Make sure you have `pipenv`
installed: [https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).
3. Install [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and create a user.
4. Copy the file `.env_example` to `.env` and set the variables of the mongoDB.
5. Run the script import2mongo.py to import the data to mongodb: `python import2mongo.py`
This step requires you to have [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed.

Now that the data is in the DB, you can now open the notebook using jupyter: `jupyter notebook`. 

The file `profiles.html` is the notebook exported in html format.

# The Project COP-MODE

COP-MODE (COntext-aware Privacy protection for MObile DEvices) is a research project led by the University of Coimbra, the University of Porto and the University of Cambridge aiming at enhancing the privacy of mobile devices.

The objective of this project is to develop a privacy manager that is:
* **Automatic** -- Automation reduces warning fatigue and intrusiveness generated by constant permission prompts.
* **Context-Aware** -- Privacy is highly context-dependent. It depends on where we are, on what we are doing and with whom. A context-aware privacy mechanism is capable to adapt in order to respect personal privacy preferences as a function of each context.
* **Personalized** -- Privacy is also subjective and personal. A personalized mechanism must learn to adjust the privacy settings in accordance with personal preferences.

This repository is to showcase the possibility of building privacy profiles towards
personalization.
